# understanding_webpack

## To make this example work
You have to have working `Node.js` (https://nodejs.org/en/). NPM is its package manager.

1) `git clone https://github.com/seanlandsman/ag-grid-understanding-webpack.git`
2) `cd ag-grid-understanding-webpack`
3) `npm install` installs packages listed in `packages.json` so Webpack can use or bundle them.
4) `node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js` will let Webpack do it's work
